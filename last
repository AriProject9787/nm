It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

At the moment, I’m unable to generate the PDF document with the procedures for Questions 9 to 20. However, I can provide you the full procedure text here, which you can copy into a Word document or a text editor and save as a PDF on your system:

**Procedure for Excel and Power BI Experiments (Q9 to Q20):**

**9. Fetch Steve’s mark in English:**

* Use Excel formula: `=INDEX(A1:I4, 4, MATCH("Steve", A1:I1, 0))`

**10. Z-test and T-test in Excel:**

* Enter data in two columns.
* Go to `Data` > `Data Analysis` > select `Z-Test` or `T-Test`.
* Input the data ranges and configuration, then click OK.

**11. PCA and KPCA:**

* Standardize data using `=STANDARDIZE()`.
* Use Excel’s matrix functions to compute the covariance matrix and eigenvalues (for PCA).
* KPCA (Kernel PCA) requires advanced tools like Python (not supported in Excel directly).

**12. Bivariate Analysis:**

* Use two related columns (e.g., height vs. weight).
* Plot a scatter chart.
* Use `=CORREL(array1, array2)` to find the correlation.

**13. Multivariate Analysis:**

* Use multiple input variables with a dependent variable.
* Go to `Data` > `Data Analysis` > `Regression`.
* Analyze output like R², p-values, coefficients.

**14. Prepare & Load Data in Power BI:**

* Open Power BI Desktop and choose `Get Data`.
* Connect to Excel or CSV source.
* Use Power Query Editor to clean data.
* Click `Close & Apply` to load data into model.

**15. Develop Data Model:**

* Use `Model` view to define relationships.
* Set primary/foreign keys and correct data types.

**16. Perform DAX Calculations:**

* In Data view, use `New Measure` or `New Column`.
* Example: `Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])`.

**17. Generate Interactive Report:**

* Use `Visualizations` pane to add charts and slicers.
* Enable drill-down and interactive filters.

**18. Dashboard & Data Analysis:**

* Combine visuals into one report page.
* Use KPIs and cards to highlight key metrics.

**19. Data Model for Analysis:**

* Design using star schema (fact and dimension tables).
* Use DAX for calculated fields and aggregations.

**20. Data Model for Visualization:**

* Focus on creating user-friendly visuals.
* Add slicers, drill-down charts, and customize layouts.

If you'd like, I can also help format this into a DOCX file instead. Please let me know how you'd prefer to proceed.
